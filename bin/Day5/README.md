 # Q5 Sparse Matrix and its representations (Using Arrays)
 A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.
 - `Example: `
 - `0 0 3 0 4  `          
 - `0 0 5 7 0`
- `0 0 0 0 0`
- `0 2 6 0 0`
